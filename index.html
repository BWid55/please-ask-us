      <h1>Together, let's make kindness contagious</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Please Ask Us! We're Brendan and Ryan, the co-founders of this site dedicated to spreading kindness and compassion. Our mission is simple: to encourage people to ask for help when they need it and to provide it without hesitation or judgment. We believe that kindness is contagious and that by helping others, we can create a ripple effect of positivity that can change the world.</p>
      <p>Our story began when Brendan offered to pick up shifts at work so that Ryan could spend more time with his newborn son and attend church. Ryan was surprised by Brendan's kindness, especially since Brendan is an atheist. But Brendan believed in the importance of helping others, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. That simple act of kindness inspired Ryan to think about how they could spread that same spirit of generosity to others. And thus, Please Ask Us was born.</p>
      <p>We hope that our website will serve as a hub for people who want to help others, who want to give back to their communities, and who believe in the power of simple kindness. We invite you to join us on this journey and to make a difference in the lives of others, one act of kindness at a time. Together, let's create a world that's a little bit kinder, a little bit more compassionate, and a little bit brighter.</p>
      <p>At Please Ask Us, we believe in complete transparency when it comes to finances. We want our visitors to know that every dollar we receive goes directly towards running our website and improving our movement. We are committed to using your contributions wisely, and we will always be open and honest about where your money is going. You can trust that your support will make a real difference in the lives of others, and we thank you for being a part of our mission to spread kindness and compassion.</p>
